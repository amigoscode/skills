description: "Generate 'HOW X WORKS' educational infographic diagrams for Amigoscode — hand-drawn style diagrams about backend/Java topics, composited onto a branded HTML template and screenshotted into a final PNG. Use this skill whenever the user wants to create an infographic, a 'how X works' diagram, an educational diagram, a tech explainer image, or mentions 'infographic', 'how does X work diagram', 'create a diagram about', 'explain X visually', or any request to produce a branded Amigoscode educational visual. Even if the user just names a topic like 'Docker', 'Kafka', 'Kubernetes', 'Spring Boot', etc. and wants a visual explanation — this skill applies. Triggers on: 'infographic', 'how X works', 'diagram about', 'explain visually', 'educational poster', 'Amigoscode diagram'."

# Infographic — "HOW X WORKS" Diagram Generator

Generate branded educational infographic diagrams. The user provides a topic, you generate everything and deliver a final PNG plus caption.

**Two required deliverables for every run:**
1. The final branded PNG (Steps 1 to 5)
2. `caption.txt` (Step 6)

You are NOT done until BOTH exist in the output folder. Create a todo per step so the caption is not skipped. The image alone is an incomplete result.

Branding (logo, footer text) is configurable in `~/amigoscode-skills/infographic-config.json`. See **Step 0**. Bundled defaults work out of the box.

## Prerequisites

- A `GEMINI_API_KEY` (from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). Export it in your shell, or copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add it there.
- Node.js with `npx` available. The generator runs via `tsx` and the screenshot step uses Playwright.
- Run `npm install` once in the repo root to install dependencies.

Paths below are written relative to the skill's own directory (the folder containing this `SKILL.md`), referred to as `SKILL_DIR`. Run commands from there, or substitute the absolute install path.

## Output Structure

All output goes into a **capitalized folder with spaces** under the configured output directory (`config.json` field `outputDir`, default `~/amigoscode-skills/infographic`):

```
<outputDir>/How [Topic] Works/
├── How [Topic] Works Raw.jpg    ← the raw hand-drawn diagram from Gemini
├── How [Topic] Works.html       ← intermediate HTML (template + diagram)
├── How [Topic] Works.png        ← FINAL branded image (Playwright screenshot)
└── caption.txt                  ← dev-friendly explanation, no hashtags
```

Examples (with the default `outputDir`):
- `~/amigoscode-skills/infographic/How Docker Works/`
- `~/amigoscode-skills/infographic/How Kafka Works/`
- `~/amigoscode-skills/infographic/How API Gateway Works/`

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 0: Load configuration

Read `~/amigoscode-skills/infographic-config.json` (expand `~`).

- **If it exists**, load and use its values.
- **If it does NOT exist** (first run), create the `~/amigoscode-skills/` folder if needed and copy `SKILL_DIR/config.default.json` to `~/amigoscode-skills/infographic-config.json`, then use it.

The bundled `config.default.json` already holds working Amigoscode defaults, so the skill produces correct output even before anything is edited. To customize, edit `~/amigoscode-skills/infographic-config.json` (no need to touch the skill folder). Fields:

1. **footerText**: the URL or text shown at the bottom-left of every infographic. Default: `www.amigoscode.com`.
2. **logoPath**: path to an SVG or PNG wordmark shown bottom-center. Default: `assets/amigoscode-wordmark.svg` (bundled, relative paths resolve against `SKILL_DIR`). Also used as the fallback icon for topics with no specific tech icon.
3. **personPhoto**: the author's photo shown top-left (circular avatar before the tech icon). Empty string or a missing file means no photo.
4. **outputDir**: where infographics are saved. Default: `~/amigoscode-skills/infographic`.
5. **ctaLine** / **newsletterUrl** / **newsletterLine**: caption closing lines (see Step 6).

Use `footerText`, `logoPath`, `outputDir`, `personPhoto`, and the caption lines throughout the workflow below.

### Step 1: Create the output directory

```bash
mkdir -p "<outputDir>"/"How [Topic] Works"
```

### Step 2: Fill in the prompt template

Take the user's topic and fill in every `[placeholder]` in the prompt template below. Think carefully about:
- **Technical accuracy** — the audience is mid-to-senior Java/backend developers
- **Interview relevance** — concepts should be things engineers discuss in system design interviews
- **Visual clarity** — each "Draw" description must be a specific scene with boxes, arrows, labels — not just an icon name

### Step 3: Generate the diagram image

Use the bundled `generate-diagram.ts` script which sends **all reference images** to Gemini in a single request, giving it maximum context for style-matching. Run from `SKILL_DIR/assets` and pass every reference image with `--ref`:

```bash
cd "SKILL_DIR/assets" && npx tsx generate-diagram.ts \
  --ref reference-rate-limiting.jpeg \
  --ref reference-linux-processes.jpeg \
  --ref reference-kafka.jpeg \
  --prompt "<your filled-in prompt>" \
  --output "<outputDir>/How [Topic] Works/How [Topic] Works Raw.png"
```

The script reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` from your environment, falling back to a `.env` file in the repo root (see Prerequisites).

**Reference images** (all in `SKILL_DIR/assets/`):
- `reference-rate-limiting.jpeg`: "How Rate Limiting Works" diagram
- `reference-linux-processes.jpeg`: "How Linux Processes Work" diagram
- `reference-kafka.jpeg`: "How Kafka Works" diagram

All three are passed as visual context so Gemini can see the exact hand-drawn style, layout structure, colour usage, and illustration quality to replicate.

Note: Gemini may save as `.jpg` instead of `.png`. That is fine, just use whatever extension it produces for the HTML template `src`.

### Step 4: Create the branded HTML

Read the template from `SKILL_DIR/assets/template.html` and create a copy in the output directory, replacing the placeholders:
- `{{PERSON_PHOTO}}`: the author photo (see person photo rules below)
- `{{ICON_PATH}}`: the tech icon (see icon rules below)
- `{{TITLE}}`: the topic title, ALL CAPS. Keep it SHORT so the icon + title row fits (see title rules below)
- `{{DIAGRAM_SRC}}`: the raw diagram filename (relative to the HTML file, so just the filename works)
- `{{DIAGRAM_ALT}}`: the topic name
- `{{FOOTER_TEXT}}`: `footerText` from `config.json` (optional, see footer rules)
- `{{LOGO_PATH}}`: `logoPath` from `config.json`, as an absolute path so the screenshot can resolve it (optional, see footer rules)

**General rule: every config-driven element is optional. If its `config.json` field is missing or an empty string, REMOVE that element from the HTML instead of leaving an empty value or a broken `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`.** This applies to `personPhoto`, `logoPath`, `footerText` (and to `ctaLine`/`newsletterUrl` in the caption, Step 6). The tech icon and title are the only always-present header elements.

Layout: the **person photo sits top-left**; the **tech icon + title sit top-right, right-aligned** (icon then title).

Person photo rules:
- Read `personPhoto` from `config.json`. If it is a non-empty path AND the file exists, set `{{PERSON_PHOTO}}` to its absolute path (expand a leading `~` to the home directory) so the screenshot can resolve it.
- **If `personPhoto` is empty/missing, or the file does not exist, REMOVE the whole `<div class="person-photo">...</div>` element.** Then the row is just icon → title.

Icon rules:
- Pick the appropriate tech icon URL (lobehub or devicon) for `{{ICON_PATH}}`.
- **If the topic is generic/comparison with no specific technology icon**, set `{{ICON_PATH}}` to the absolute path of `logoPath` from `config.json` (the brand logo doubles as the fallback icon). Do not leave a default placeholder.
- **Keep the icon whenever there is a source for it** (a real tech icon, or `logoPath` as the generic fallback). Only if the topic is generic AND `logoPath` is missing/empty (no icon source at all) do you remove the `<div class="tech-icon">` element.

Title rules:
- **If the full "HOW X WORKS" title is long (more than ~16 characters) and would collide with the icon, SHORTEN the on-image title instead of removing the icon.** Trim filler words: drop "HOW" and "WORKS/WORK" and any redundant words, keeping only the core subject so it fits on one line next to the icon.
- Examples: "HOW JAVA VIRTUAL THREADS WORK" → "VIRTUAL THREADS"; "HOW KUBERNETES SCHEDULING WORKS" → "K8S SCHEDULING"; "JAVA PASS BY VALUE VS REFERENCE" → "PASS BY VALUE"; "10 AI TERMS EVERY DEV MUST KNOW" → "AI TERMS".
- The icon often already conveys the technology, so the shortened title does not need to repeat it (a Java icon plus "VIRTUAL THREADS" reads cleanly).
- Short titles like "HOW SSH WORKS" or "HOW DOCKER WORKS" already fit and need no shortening.
- The **folder name** always uses the full "How [Topic] Works" form. Only the on-image `{{TITLE}}` is shortened.

Footer rules:
- `{{LOGO_PATH}}` (bottom-left wordmark): if `logoPath` is non-empty, set it to the absolute path (expand a leading `~`). **If `logoPath` is empty/missing, REMOVE the whole `<div class="logo">...</div>` element.**
- `{{FOOTER_TEXT}}` (bottom-center website text): if `footerText` is non-empty, use it. **If `footerText` is empty/missing, REMOVE the `<span class="bottom-url">...</span>` element.**
- If both are empty, the bottom bar renders nothing, which is fine.

Save as `<outputDir>/How [Topic] Works/How [Topic] Works.html`.

### Step 5: Screenshot with Playwright (headless)

Use Playwright CLI in headless mode to capture the branded slide as a PNG. Build the `file://` URL from the absolute path of the HTML file, URL-encoding spaces as `%20`.

**IMPORTANT: pass `--viewport-size "1200,1581"`** so the capture matches the 1200px slide width exactly. Without it, Playwright uses a 1280px default viewport and leaves ~80px of dead space on the right, which makes the right-aligned title look like it has more padding than the left photo.

```bash
npx playwright screenshot \
  --browser chromium \
  --full-page \
  --viewport-size "1200,1581" \
  --wait-for-timeout 3000 \
  "file://<absolute-path-to>/How%20[Topic]%20Works/How%20[Topic]%20Works.html" \
  "<outputDir>/How [Topic] Works/How [Topic] Works.png"
```

This PNG is the branded image, but the run is **not finished**: you must still write the caption in Step 6.

### Step 6: Write the caption

Create `caption.txt` in the output directory using the system prompt below.

**Use the two configurable footer lines straight from `config.json`. Do NOT ask the user every run.** They are bundled into config so the run stays uninterrupted:

1. **Closing CTA line** — use `config.json` field `ctaLine` verbatim as the final line. If `ctaLine` is empty/missing, omit the closing CTA line entirely.
2. **Mailing list line** — if `config.json` has a non-empty `newsletterUrl`, add the subscribe line by taking the `newsletterLine` template and replacing `{{NEWSLETTER_URL}}` with `newsletterUrl`. If `newsletterUrl` is empty or missing, omit the subscribe line.

Only revisit these if the user explicitly asks to change the CTA or newsletter wording/link in their message; in that case update the relevant `config.json` field and use the new value. Otherwise never prompt.

Caption ending order: engaging question, then "Share your thoughts below", then the mailing list subscribe line (if any), then the closing CTA line. Use the `→` symbol for the subscribe line, not a hyphen or arrow made of characters.

**Then READ `assets/caption-examples.md` end-to-end.** That file contains a menu of strong hook patterns and four worked examples each using a DIFFERENT hook style. Pick a hook pattern that matches the topic and rotate styles across the week — never use the same opener twice in a row.

**Caption system prompt:**

```
You are a senior software engineer working at Amigoscode.

You deeply understand backend engineering, Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, system design, and real world production systems.

You are exceptional at explaining complex technical systems so beginners can understand them clearly.

You are also an expert LinkedIn content creator for the software engineering niche.

Your job is to transform technical infographics or diagrams into educational LinkedIn posts that simplify complex systems and build strong engineering intuition.

Follow these rules strictly:

Do NOT describe the image or infographic.
Do NOT repeat the text from the image.
Go straight into explaining the core concept behind the system.

The opener is the single most important line. Pick ONE of these eight hook patterns and use it:
1. Contrast / parallelism — "Juniors do X. Seniors do Y."
2. Direct reframe — "X is not magic. It is Y."
3. Specific concrete pain — name an exact symptom the reader has felt
4. Imperative / challenge — "Stop doing X." or "Read X before Y."
5. Counter-intuitive claim — open with something readers do not expect to be true
6. Specific number / fact — anchor in a concrete count or surprising statistic
7. Question — ask something the reader cannot confidently answer
8. Incident / story — open with a real (or representative) failure

NEVER open with:
- "Today we are going to talk about..."
- "Let me tell you about..."
- Restating the title of the image
- Any sentence starting with the word "I"

Explain the system using a clear mental model instead of definitions.
Break the concept down step by step in a simple way.
Use bullet points with this symbol only:
→
Do NOT add line breaks between bullet points.
Focus on helping beginners understand how things actually work in practice.
Highlight common mistakes developers make when working with this system.
Show how senior engineers think differently about the same concept.
Keep language simple, clear, and practical.
Avoid jargon unless you explain it simply.
Ask engaging questions at the end to encourage comments and discussion.
Always finish with a soft call to action encouraging readers to follow Amigoscode for software engineering insights.

Output rules:
Plain text only
No markdown
No bold text
No emojis
No special characters
No em dashes or en dashes

Tone:
Senior engineer mentor
Clear
Practical
Insight driven
Beginner friendly but not simplistic
```

Reference `assets/caption-examples.md` for the full hook menu, the "Avoid" list, and four worked examples each demonstrating a different opener. Match the voice and arrow grouping; vary the hook.

### Step 7: Update the CSV tracker (OPTIONAL)

This step is **optional** and only applies if you keep a content-planning CSV. It is **skipped by default**. Run it only when a tracker CSV exists at `config.json` field `trackerCsv` (no default, so absent means skip).

If you use one, the expected columns are `name,generated,rank,instagram,linkedin,youtube`. Update the row for the topic (fuzzy match on `name`, e.g. "How Docker Works" matches "Docker") by setting `generated` to `yes`, appending a new row if none matches:

```bash
python3 -c "
import csv, os
csv_path = os.path.expanduser('<trackerCsv path>')
topic = '[TOPIC NAME]'  # e.g. 'How Docker Works'
rows = list(csv.DictReader(open(csv_path)))
found = False
for r in rows:
    if topic.lower() in r['name'].lower() or r['name'].lower() in topic.lower():
        r['generated'] = 'yes'
        found = True
        break
if not found:
    rows.append({'name': topic, 'generated': 'yes', 'rank': '8', 'instagram': 'false', 'linkedin': 'false', 'youtube': 'false'})
with open(csv_path, 'w', newline='') as f:
    w = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=['name','generated','rank','instagram','linkedin','youtube'])
    w.writeheader()
    w.writerows(rows)
print(f'CSV updated: {topic} -> generated=yes')
"
```

### Step 8: Deliver

First confirm BOTH deliverables exist in the output folder: the final PNG and `caption.txt`. If `caption.txt` is missing, go back and do Step 6 now.

Then show the user the final branded PNG, paste the caption, and tell them the output directory path.

## Image Generation Prompt Template

This is the complete prompt to fill in and send to the generate-diagram script. Replace every `[placeholder]` with real content for the user's topic.

Always prepend this line at the top of the prompt:
```
These three reference images show the exact visual style I want you to replicate. Match the hand-drawn marker style, layout structure, Amigoscode purple (#7F56D9) accent colour, numbered circles, section headings with underlines, and illustration quality exactly.
```

Then the main template:

```
Create a hand-drawn educational diagram on a clean digital canvas —
like detailed notes a senior dev wrote by hand but scanned perfectly flat.

**Dimensions:** 1000px wide by 1300px tall. Exactly 1000x1300.
Portrait orientation. All content must fit within this canvas
without cropping or overflow.

**Critical style rules:**
- PURE WHITE background — hex #FFFFFF, RGB(255,255,255).
  Do NOT add any paper texture, grain, noise, shadow, or vignette.
  Do NOT make it look like paper or a physical surface.
  Do NOT add warmth, coolness, or any tint whatsoever.
  The background must be completely flat, clean, digital white —
  the same as a blank PNG canvas exported from Photoshop.
  Treat the background as a digital document, not a physical material.
- IMPORTANT: NO title text anywhere on the diagram. Start directly
  with the two intro blurbs. No heading, no banner, no label,
  no box with the topic name. If you are about to draw a title — STOP.
- NO whiteboard frame, NO sticky notes, NO coloured boxes, NO banner headers
- Everything hand-drawn like someone sketched it with markers
- Feels like clean, detailed how-to notes — easy to scan, not cluttered
- Bold ALL CAPS marker-style font for section headings only
- Remaining text in casual handwritten marker style — slightly imperfect
- Hand-drawn numbered circles for each step — outline style only

**Theme colour rules (auto-detected from icon):**

The primary accent colour should match the technology's official brand.
Look up the icon you chose for Step 4 and use that technology's brand colour.

Common mappings (use these, or look up the correct hex for any technology):
- kubernetes → #326CE5 (blue)
- docker → #2496ED (blue)
- git → #F05032 (orange-red)
- java → #E76F00 (orange)
- spring → #6DB33F (green)
- github/githubactions → #181717 (black)
- kafka → #231F20 (dark)
- intellij → #FE315D (pink)
- claude/claudecode → #D97757 (coral)
- postgresql → #4169E1 (blue)
- redis → #DC382D (red)
- mongodb → #47A248 (green)
- react → #61DAFB (cyan)
- python → #3776AB (blue)
- rust → #DEA584 (copper)
- go → #00ADD8 (cyan)
- typescript → #3178C6 (blue)
- No icon / generic → #7F56D9 (Amigoscode purple)

If the user says "use amigoscode theme" or "use purple", override
with #7F56D9 (Amigoscode purple) instead.

Apply the chosen primary colour to: section headings, underlines,
numbered circles, arrows, and coloured segments beneath intro blurbs.

- Dark: #181D2F (Amigoscode dark navy) — always used for body text and outlines
- Background: #FFFFFF (white) — canvas only
- Icons and illustrations use full original brand colours

**Icon rules:**
- All icons rendered in flat bold colour — not outline, not gradient,
  not faded. Solid filled colour like a sticker or flat illustration.

**Illustration rules:**
- Each step must have a small hand-drawn illustrative sketch, not just
  a symbol. Draw a small scene that visually explains the concept.
- All sketches hand-drawn, rough, energetic — not clipart, not flat icons

**Arrow rules:**
- Arrows connect steps WITHIN each section only (1→2→3→4 and 5→6→7→8).
- Do NOT draw any arrow between Section 1 and Section 2.
  Step 4 does NOT connect to Step 5. There is a clear visual break
  between the two sections — the section heading acts as the separator.
- No step should have two outgoing arrows.
- All arrows use the chosen theme colour.

**Tone:** Clean, simple, senior dev hand-drawn notes. Rich coloured
illustrations per concept. Amigoscode brand colours throughout.
Not childish, not cluttered.

**Top blurbs:**
- Left: What [TOPIC] is — [one punchy line, max 20 words]
- Right: Why it matters — [one punchy line, max 20 words]

**Spacing rule:** Leave a LARGE visible gap (about 80-100px of white space)
between the top blurbs and the first section heading below them.
This is important — the intro blurbs and the section content must feel
like two clearly separate zones. Do not let them run together.
Think of it as a paragraph break, not a line break.

**Section 1: [SECTION NAME — 3 words max, ALL CAPS]**
(#7F56D9 underline)
Subtext: [One line explaining what this section covers]
  1. [Concept name] — [one line explanation, max 20 words]
     | Draw: [specific hand-drawn scene — boxes, arrows, labels]
  2. [Concept name] — [one line explanation, max 20 words]
     | Draw: [specific hand-drawn scene]
  3. [Concept name] — [one line explanation, max 20 words]
     | Draw: [specific hand-drawn scene]
  4. [Concept name] — [one line explanation, max 20 words]
     | Draw: [specific hand-drawn scene]

**Section 2: [SECTION NAME — 3 words max, ALL CAPS]**
(#7F56D9 underline)
Subtext: [One line explaining what this section covers]
  1. [Concept name] — [one line explanation, max 20 words]
     | Draw: [specific hand-drawn scene]
  2. [Concept name] — [one line explanation, max 20 words]
     | Draw: [specific hand-drawn scene]
  3. [Concept name] — [one line explanation, max 20 words]
     | Draw: [specific hand-drawn scene]
  4. [Concept name] — [one line explanation, max 20 words]
     | Draw: [specific hand-drawn scene]

**Arrow flow (within sections only — NO arrow between sections):**
Section 1: [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3] → [Step 4]
Section 2: [Step 5] → [Step 6] → [Step 7] → [Step 8]
(Do NOT connect Step 4 to Step 5 — the section heading is the separator.)
```

## Rules for filling in the template

- Target audience: mid to senior Java and backend developers
- Concepts must be technically accurate and interview-relevant
- Each "Draw" description must be a specific visual scene — describe boxes, arrows, labels, flow — not just an icon name
- Section names must be short, punchy, ALL CAPS, max 3 words
- Arrow flow must be exactly 8 steps — 4 from Section 1 then 4 from Section 2, no branching, one direction only
- Use the auto-detected theme colour from the icon (or #7F56D9 Amigoscode purple for generic topics)
- Never add extra sections, commentary, or text outside the template
- Replace every [placeholder] with real content for the topic

## Reference Images

The `assets/` directory contains reference images that show the exact visual style to match:

- `assets/reference-rate-limiting.jpeg` — "How Rate Limiting Works" diagram
- `assets/reference-linux-processes.jpeg` — "How Linux Processes Work" diagram
- `assets/reference-kafka.jpeg` — "How Kafka Works" diagram

Always pass **all three** reference images via `--ref` flags to `generate-diagram.ts` so Gemini gets maximum visual context for style-matching.

## HTML Template

The template is at `assets/template.html`. It uses placeholders (filled in Step 4) and contains:
- **Top-left**: person photo `{{PERSON_PHOTO}}` (112px circular avatar, from `config.personPhoto`, removed when empty/missing)
- **Top-right** (right-aligned, icon then title): tech icon `{{ICON_PATH}}` (80px, from lobehub/devicon CDN, or the brand `logoPath` for generic topics; always present), then Title `{{TITLE}}` in bold uppercase Inter font
- **Center**: The diagram image `{{DIAGRAM_SRC}}` (`object-fit: contain`)
- **Bottom-left**: Brand wordmark `{{LOGO_PATH}}` (38px height), from `config.json`
- **Bottom-center**: Footer text `{{FOOTER_TEXT}}` (Epilogue font, regular weight), from `config.json`

The bundled brand asset is `assets/amigoscode-wordmark.svg` (default `logoPath`). Point `config.json` at your own file to rebrand.

Tech icon sources for `{{ICON_PATH}}` (in priority order):
1. **Lobehub CDN**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@lobehub/icons-static-png@latest/dark/{name}-color.png`
2. **Devicon CDN**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/{name}/{name}-original.svg`
3. **Brand fallback**: the `logoPath` from `config.json` (local, for generic topics)
